# ***Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition*** 

### Introduction
The MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset is a benchmark dataset in the field of computer vision, specifically for handwritten digit recognition. It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, each a 28x28 grayscale image of a handwritten digit from 0 to 9. Due to its simplicity and well-defined nature, MNIST has been extensively used as a starting point for researchers and practitioners to test and compare various machine learning algorithms.

#### Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop an accurate model capable of recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. This involves:

* Loading and preprocessing the MNIST dataset
* Building and training a suitable machine learning model
* Evaluating the model's performance on the test dataset
